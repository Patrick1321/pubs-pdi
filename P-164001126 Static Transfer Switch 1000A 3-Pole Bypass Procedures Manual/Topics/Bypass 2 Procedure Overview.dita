<title>Bypass 2 Procedure Overview</title>
<body>
<p>Bypass 2 Procedure is symmetric to the Bypass 1 Procedure. </p>
<p>At the start of this procedure, Source 2 is assumed the active
power source. Refer to the STS Monitorâ€™s One-Line mimic on the STS
Home screen to verify that Source 2 (SCR 2) is powering the load.
If going to bypass on Bypass Source 2: <ol>
<li><p>Turn OFF Source 1. (This insures that the opposite source is
not active while Bypass 2 is active.) </p></li>
<li><p>Turn ON (close) Bypass Source 2. (Bypass Source 1 and 2 cannot
be active together. The bar on the dead front panels prevents you
removing both Bypass 1 and Bypass 2 keys at once.) </p></li>
<li><p>Turn OFF (open) Source 2 and lock out. </p></li>
<li><p>Turn OFF (open) the Isolation MCCBs or MCSWs.</p></li>
</ol></p>
