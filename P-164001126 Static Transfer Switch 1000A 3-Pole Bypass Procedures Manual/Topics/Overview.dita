<p>At the start of this procedure, Source 1 is assumed the active
power source. Refer to the STS Monitorâ€™s One-Line mimic on the STS
Home screen to verify that Source 1 (SCR 1) is powering the load. </p>
<p>If going to bypass on Bypass Source 1: <ol>
<li><p>Turn OFF (open) Source 2 and lock out. (This ensures that the
source on the opposite side is not active while Bypass 1 is active.) </p
></li>
<li><p>Turn ON (close) Bypass Source 1. (Bypass Source 1 and 2 cannot
be active together. The bar on the dead front panels prevents you
removing both Bypass 1 and Bypass 2 keys at once.) </p></li>
<li><p>Turn OFF (open) Source 1 and lock out. </p></li>
<li><p>Turn OFF (open) the Isolation MCCBs or MCSWs.</p></li>
