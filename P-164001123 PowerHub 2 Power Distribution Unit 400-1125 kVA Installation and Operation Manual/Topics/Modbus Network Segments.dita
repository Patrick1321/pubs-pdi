<title>Modbus Network Segments</title>
<body>
<p>In a Modbus network there can be only one primary, and only the
primary can poll a downstream device. However, the Color Monitor must
also poll its downstream devices. Because there cannot be two Modbus
primaries, the network is divided into segments at the Monitor with
one primary per segment (<xref format="dita"

<ul>
<li><p>Upstream segment: DCIM or BIM system is primary to the Monitor;
Monitor is a secondary device. </p></li>
<li><p>Downstream segment: Monitor is primary to its downstream devices.</p
></li>
</ul>
<p>An upstream Modbus primary device cannot directly address devices
that are downstream of the Color Monitor because the Monitor is an
endpoint of the Modbus primaryâ€™s network segment. Instead, the Monitor
translates its downstream device addresses to upstream segment addresses,
which are assigned sequentially starting at its own Modbus address.
When the upstream Modbus primary requests data from a device in the
internal PDU network, it addresses the device indirectly through the
Monitor.</p>
