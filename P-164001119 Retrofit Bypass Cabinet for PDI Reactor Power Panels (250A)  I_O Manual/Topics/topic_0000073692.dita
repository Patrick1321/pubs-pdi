<p>A Retrofit Bypass Cabinet is a 12"-wide cabinet that provides a
bypass function for Eaton (PDI) 250A RPPs. The Retrofit Bypass Cabinet
has mechanically interlocking switches to transfer power between main
RPP power and reserve power. The Retrofit Bypass Cabinet can be manufactured
for left-hand (LH) or right-hand (RH) orientation for installation
on the left or right side of an RPP.</p>
<p>Customerâ€™s installers must prepare the Retrofit Bypass Cabinet
and RPP for installation on-site, wire the power cabling between the
Bypass Cabinet and RPP, and connect external reserve power and load
(busway) cables. </p>
<p>Customer is also responsible for setting up monitoring in the Retrofit
Bypass Cabinet.</p>
