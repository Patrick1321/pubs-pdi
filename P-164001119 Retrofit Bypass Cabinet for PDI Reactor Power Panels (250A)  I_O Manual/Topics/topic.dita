<p>Eaton Retrofit Bypass Cabinets (250A) are designed as an extension
to installed Reactor Power Panels (RPPs). A Retrofit Bypass Cabinet
allows input power to be switched between the main RPP power source
and a reserve power source so that the RPP can be taken off line without
interrupting power to the load.</p>
<p>Reactor Power Panels (RPPs) make maintenance of downstream equipment
safer by limiting fault current and reducing the risk of arc flash.
A reserve power source for the Bypass temporarily provides the same
safety benefits as the dedicated RPP while the RPP is off line for
maintenance.</p>
<p>Eaton Retrofit Bypass Cabinets are available for installed Eaton
(PDI) and Vertiv RPPs. This manual describes installation and operation
of Retrofit Bypass Cabinets for Eaton (PDI) RPPs. A separate manual
(Number P-164001120) describes installation and operation of the Retrofit
Bypass Cabinet for Vertiv RPPs.</p>
