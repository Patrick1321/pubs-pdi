<p>The Enhanced Contractor Board ( <xref format="dita"
href="#./Figure22EnhancedContractorBoard-CAE49811" scope="local"

>) provides twice as many relays and building alarms as the Basic
Contractor Board. The Enhanced Contractor Board is used in other Eaton
PDI products and many of the connectors are not used on PDUs. </p>
<p>24VDC Power Input: Unlike the Basic Contractor Board, the Enhanced
Contractor Board has a processor and uses 24VDC power from the PDU
M4G Board.</p>
<p><b>Inputs:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remote EPO: Dry contact connection point for input of a REPO
signal to system. Connection of voltage to this point can cause damage
to the unit. Connect external dry contacts to terminals marked <b
>+24V EPO RET</b> <xref format="dita"
href="#./Figure22EnhancedContractorBoard-CAE49811" scope="local"

>. The REPO signal is sent to the PDU Board via the REMOTE EPO connection,
which is not a customer connection point. </p></li>
<li><p>Eight (8) Building Alarms (<xref format="dita"
href="#./Figure22EnhancedContractorBoard-CAE49811" scope="local"
type="fig"><?Pub _previewtext text="Enhanced Contractor Board"?></xref
>). Alarm names can be specified by Eaton PDI in PDU Board setup.</p
></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Outputs:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Eight (8) remote relays that output dry contact (NO) signals
(<xref format="dita" href="#./Figure22EnhancedContractorBoard-CAE49811"
scope="local" type="fig">Figure 22</xref>). <note>Remote relay scan
accept dry contacts rated up to 2A/250V.</note><ul>
<li><p>Relays are programmable using the USB setup connection on the
PDU M4G Board. Eaton PDI programs the relay inputs, usually in manufacturing.
So for example, a relay can be programmed to turn on when a specific
Building Alarm, such as a fire alarm, is received. The building management
system (BMS) or other control system receives the relay input, receives
the signal and can cause PDU shutdown with an REPO signal. </p></li>
<li><p>By default, the first relay<b> RR1 </b>is programmed to close
when the PDU Summary Alarm, PDU Board points list, Modbus Register
70, is in alarm.</p></li>
</ul></p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Modbus Connection</b>: 4-wire configuration connection is located
on the customer connection terminal block.</p>
