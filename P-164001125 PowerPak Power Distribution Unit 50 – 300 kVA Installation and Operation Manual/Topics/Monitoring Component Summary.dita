<title>Monitoring Component Summary</title>
<body>
<p>WaveStar monitoring components include the following: <ul>
<li><p>PDU M4G Board sets PDU parameters and monitors the transformer.
Each PDU has a Contractor Board which is an extension of the PDU Board. </p
></li>
<li><p>Branch Circuit Monitoring System (BCMS) PCBs collect readings
from CT strips on panelboard current transformer (CT) strips and subfeed
CTs and voltage measurements. </p></li>
<li><p>A Resistor Board is intermediate between subfeed CTs and a
BCMS PCB. It is used only with subfeeds. </p></li>
<li><p>The WaveStarÂ® Color Monitor displays power information about
monitored PDU devices and passes their points list information to
upstream Modbus master devices, such as a Building Management System
or Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM).</p></li>
</ul></p>
<p>Monitoring components are mostly located in the Controls Compartment
at the top of the Main Cabinet. BCMS PCBs are also placed in Side
Cars for monitoring panelboards or subfeeds in the Side Car. </p>
<p>The PDU also has an extensive dry contact network. See <xref
