<title>External Permissive Signals</title>
<body>
<p>Customer wiring for an <b>external permissive signal</b> is the
same whether the external signal is used alone to release the SKRU
key or it is used in a two-stage system to enable the internal signal. </p>
<p>The customer connects either a <u>dry contact</u> or external applied <u
>120VAC</u> connection to a terminal block near the main breakersâ€™
Kirk Keys. The choice of dry contact or 120VAC connection must be
selected at time of order. </p>
<p>The customer must independently determine that the sources are
synchronized. Typically, the external signal is sent from an Uninterruptible
Power Supply (UPS).</p>
