<title>Using Cam Locks with Alternate Power Source (Optional)</title>
<body>
<p>Both power sources are usually hard-wired to the two main circuit
breakers. However, some customers optionally elect to connect an alternate
power source via cam locks. Cam locks have ABCG input power connections
and are color-coded for correct phase and ground connections.<fig>
<title>Optional Cam Locks for Second Power Source</title>
<image href="..\Graphics\45.pdf" scope="local"></image></fig>When
cables are connected to the cam locks, the PDU M4G board will check
that all ABC voltages are within specification (usually Â±10%) and
then check for correct phase rotation. The PDU will issue an input
phase rotation error if the operator has incorrectly connected the
cables, such as inserting B-phase into C-phase.<note>If the customer
is using cam locks to connect an alternate power source, it is not
recommended that they select the option to shut down the PDU on phase
rotation error. If the operator incorrectly wires the phase cables
into the cam locks, the PDU will shut down immediately.</note></p>
