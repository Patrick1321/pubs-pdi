<title>Changing Transformer Taps</title>
<body>
<p>Transformers have jumper cables on each phase connecting one tap
position to another. Changing the tap jumper cable connection changes
the transformer voltage output by a predefined percentage. Each transformer
has a label showing the voltage adjustment provided by a specific
tap connection. Default connection is 100% of the transformer rating.<fig>

</fig>To change transformer taps on the PDU follow these steps (To
change transformer taps on PDU with front-facing taps, the procedure
is the same except that the customer need only open front panel doors.): <ol>
<li><p>Make sure that the PDU is powered off. </p></li>
<li><p>Lock out power to the PDU at main circuit breaker(s). </p></li>
<li><p>Remove rear panels or, if transformer is front-accessible,
open PDU front doors. </p></li>
<li><p>Read label on transformer and select the voltage adjustment
that is closest to the adjustment you require. </p></li>
<li><p>Disconnect one or both jumper ends as needed to match tap jumper
numbers, retaining bolts and nuts. </p></li>
<li><p>Reconnect jumpers to correct numbered positions. Jumpers use
1/4-20 x 1‚Äù hex head bolts. Torque bolts to 72 inch-pounds or 6 foot-pounds.
Apply torque seal. The bolt size and torque specifications are the
same for all standard transformers.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace panels or close doors.</p></li>
