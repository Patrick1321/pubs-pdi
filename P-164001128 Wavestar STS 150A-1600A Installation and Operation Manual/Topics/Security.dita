<li><p>To reduce the possibility of issues with STS operation that
may be factored to human input, there are several security options
designed into the unit to protect the system. </p></li>
<li><p>No operations through the touch screen monitor can be completed
without a valid login. A Password (PW) and PIN# are required by the
operator in order to login. The PIN # identifies the operator and
records their activities during the login period in the event log.
There is also an optional fingerprint and/or swipe card device that
can be installed for the auto entry of Password and the PIN #. Contact
Eaton Customer Support for information regarding these options. </p

<li><p>If the front door is opened without a valid login, the unit
alarms and the alarm is logged into the event log. All operation of
the internal MCSW/MCCBs is tied in the event log to the operatorâ€™s
Login identification.</p></li>
