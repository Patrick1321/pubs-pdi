<p>A Retrofit Bypass Cabinet is a 12"-wide cabinet that provides a
bypass function for Vertiv 250A RPPs. The Retrofit Bypass Cabinet
has mechanically interlocking switches to transfer power between main
RPP power and reserve power. The Retrofit Bypass Cabinet can be manufactured
for left-hand (LH) or right-hand (RH) orientation for installation
on the left or right side of an RPP.</p>

Bypass Cabinet and RPP, and connect external reserve power and load
(busway) cables. </p>
