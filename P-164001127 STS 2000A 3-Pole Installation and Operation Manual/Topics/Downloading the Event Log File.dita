<title>Downloading the Event Log File</title>
<body>
<p>A USB port on the front of the touchscreen display compartment
lets you download the log file to a PC. When a PC is connected to
this port with a USB cable, a shortcut is created on the PCâ€™s desktop.
Clicking this shortcut will automatically download the Event Log as
a CSV file to the PC. For security reasons, no other action is taken.
The PC cannot send input to the STS and cannot request any other information. </p>
