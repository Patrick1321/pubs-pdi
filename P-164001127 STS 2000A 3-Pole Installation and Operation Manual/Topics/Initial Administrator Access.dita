<title>Initial Administrator Access</title>
<body>
<p>STS security is based on the identification of each user by a PIN
with an associated password. The PIN identifies the user and the password
allows access. This scheme also provides a login history and accurate
forensics if there is problem with the STS. </p>
<p>To initially set up STS users, Eaton PDI provides a temporary Administrator
PIN and password. The administrator should: <ol>
<li><p>Log in on the Home screen in the Operator panel. </p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the Users screen </p></li>
<li><p>Change the administrator PIN and password and then keep them
secure. </p></li>
<li><p>Set up each userâ€™s security information as described in the
following sections.</p></li>
</ol></p>
<p>After initial startup, commissioning, testing, or restart, the
administrator should clear any alarms that occurred.</p>
