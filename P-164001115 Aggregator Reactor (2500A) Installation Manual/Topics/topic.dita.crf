<title>Intended Use</title><body><p>Reactor Power Panels (RPPs) make maintenance of downstream equipment safer by limiting fault current and reducing the risk of arc flash. The 2500A Aggregator Reactor is designed to be used as part of a reserve power source for multiple downstream RPPs with Bypass Cabinets. An Aggregator Reactor, when used as a component of a reserve power source, allows multiple downstream RPPs to be taken offline for maintenance while the Aggregator Reactor temporarily provides the same safety benefits as the offline RPPs.</p>
